Naive Byes: Naive Bayes Algorithm: A Probabilistic Classification Method
The Naive Bayes algorithm is a popular machine learning technique used for classification tasks. It's a probabilistic approach that relies on Bayes' theorem to predict the likelihood of an instance belonging to a particular class. 
The algorithm assumes that the features of a dataset are independent of each other, which is why it's called "naive." 
Despite this simplification, Naive Bayes is often surprisingly accurate and effective, especially when the dataset is large and the relationships between features are complex.
It's widely used in text classification, spam detection, and image classification tasks.
